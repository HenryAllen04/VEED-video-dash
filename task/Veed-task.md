# VEED Full-Stack Engineering Challenge: Video Library Dashboard

**Time Expectation:** Approximately 4 hours

### Challenge Overview

Build a full-stack application that allows users to browse and manage their video library.

Feel free to take any shortcuts you’d like when setting up the project, such as using a template project, libraries, etc.

### Requirements

- Have a page that lists videos
    - The videos should be laid out in a grid
    - For each video, display its `title`, `created_at` date, and `tags`
    - Allow sorting based on `created_at` date
- Have a page that allows creating a new video
    - It should require you to set `title`.
    - For `tags`, allow optionally adding one or more tags.
    - For `thumbnail_url`, `created_at`, `duration`, and `views`, you can use default/placeholder values.
- Technologies we’d like you to use: Typescript, React, Node.JS.
Feel free to use anything else you’d like within reason.
- Use the provided `videos.json` to seed your dataset.
- The project can be run entirely locally, and the setup process is quick and easy.
- Provide a README describing
    - Tech stack
    - Setup instructions
    - Future improvements

### Non-functional aspects that we’ll evaluate

In no specific order:

- Code quality (structure, readability, consistency, reliability, typing)
- Project structure
- Testing (no need to test all of your code, a few examples are fine)
- API and input validation
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Quality of UI and UX
- README: describe
    - Tech stack
    - Setup instructions
    - Future improvements (not necessarily in terms of more functionality, but more in terms of what you’d polish or implement differently if you had more time)

### Provided Resources

`videos.json` - Contains array of 50+ video objects with fields: `id`, `title`, `thumbnail_url`, `created_at`, `duration` (in seconds), `views`, `tags`

### Submission Guidelines

Submit GitHub repository link containing both frontend and backend code. Include setup instructions in README.
